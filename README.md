# Goals

- Easy online viewing of the text of the awrad
  - 2 from Imam al-Haddad
  - Arabic, translation, transliteration
  - nice links that can access specific things like Quran.com (ie. bookmarks will work)

# To-do

[] Design and publish a homepage to tease the idea

[] Make mockups of the app

[] Get both awrad transcribed, and translated
  - Try using the Muwasala PDF [link to come], 
  - otherwise reach out to [freelancer like this](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~011b9eb661a288d047/)
    - Figure out how you want to receive the texts â€” so easy to manipulate and put in database (small contents, but practice good practise)
    - Model it after the Quran.com database maybe?

# Design

- Theming should be orange (Splatoon shade) and white, purple highlights (Gitlab)

- Responsive to all devices, and each of the 3 texts can be easily toggled

# Bonuses
- Account system, to favorite things, and keep track of one's reading throughout the day
  - Allow settings goals, showing streaks, progress over time
  - Feature export
  - Maybe integrate with One Quran account system

- *Mobile apps to sync and have it always with oneself* (this is worldchanging)
