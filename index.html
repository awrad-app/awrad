    <div class="mySlides">
        <q>The Prophet ﷺ said: "If your hearts were always in the state that they are in during dhikr,

        <q>The Prophet ﷺ said: "The earth and everything in it is cursed,

        <q>The Prophet ﷺ said: "Shall I tell you about the best of all deeds,
            the best act of piety in the eyes of your Lord, which will elevate your status in the Hereafter,
            and carries more virtue than the spending of gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in jihad
            and slaying or being slain in the path of Allah? The dhikr of Allah."
            <p class="author">(Malik, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Hakim)</p></q>

    <div class="mySlides">
        <q>The Prophet ﷺ said: "Everything has a polish, and the polish of hearts is dhikr
            of Allah. Nothing is more calculated to rescue from Allah's punishment than dhikr of Allah." He was asked whether
            this did not apply also to jihad in Allah's path, and he replied: "Not even if one should ply his sword until it breaks."
