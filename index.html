<h5>"O Believers, make abundant mention of ALLAH!" (33:41)</h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "If your hearts were always in the state that they are in during dhikr,
    the angels would come to see you to the point that they would greet you in the middle of the road." 
    <em>(Muslim)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "The People of Paradise will not regret except one thing alone:
    the hour that passed them by and in which they made no remembrance of Allah."
    <em>(Bayhaqi, Tabrani)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "The earth and everything in it is cursed,
    except for dhikr and what attends dhikr, and a teacher (of dhikr) and a student (of dhikr)." 
    <em>(Tirmidhi)</em></h5>
<h5>"Those who believe, and their hearts find satisfaction in the rememberance of Allah:
    By remembering Allah, truly satisfaction comes to the heart" <em>(Qur'an 13:28)</em>.</h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "Shall I tell you about the best of all deeds,
    the best act of piety in the eyes of your Lord, which will elevate your status in the Hereafter,
    and carries more virtue than the spending of gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in jihad
    and slaying or being slain in the path of Allah? The dhikr of Allah."
    <em>(Malik, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Hakim)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "Everything has a polish, and the polish of hearts is dhikr
    of Allah. Nothing is more calculated to rescue from Allah's punishment than dhikr of Allah." He was asked whether
    this did not apply also to jihad in Allah's path, and he replied: "Not even if one should ply his sword until it breaks."
    <em>(Bayhaqi)</em></h5>
<h5>"Remember Me, and I shall remember you" <em>(Qur'an 2:152)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "The single-hearted have surpassed all." They asked,
    "Who are these single-hearted people, O Prophet of Allah?" He replied, "Those men and women who remember Allah unceasingly." 
    <em>(Muslim)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: "Remember/mention Allah as much as you want, until people
    say that you are crazy and foolish" <em>(Ahmad, Ibn Hibban, Hakim)</em></h5>
<h5>"O you who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do so often; and glorify Him morning and evening." <em>(Qur'an 33:41-42)</em></h5>
<h5>The Prophet ﷺ said: 'No other act of man is a more effective means for
    his deliverance from the chastisement of Allah than the remembrance of Allah." <em>(Ahmad)</em></h5>
<h5>"Those men and women who engage much in Allah's praise. For them has Allah prepared forgiveness and a great reward."
    (Qur'an 3:191, 33:35)</h5>
<h5>And mention the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion" <em>(Qur'an 73:8)</em></h5>
<h5>Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya said: "Verily the angels lower their gaze in the
    presence of the rememberer of Allah, just as the people lower their gaze before lightning."</h5>
