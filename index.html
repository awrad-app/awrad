<h5>"O Believers, make abundant mention of ALLAH!" (33:41)</h5>
<h5>The Prophet said: "If your hearts were always in the state that they are in during dhikr,
    the angels would come to see you to the point that they would greet you in the middle of the road." Muslim narrated it.</h5>
<h5>Mu`adh ibn Jabal said that the Prophet also said: "The People of Paradise will not regret except one thing alone:
    the hour that passed them by and in which they made no remembrance of Allah."
    Narrated by Bayhaqi in Shu`ab al-iman (1:392 #512-513) and by Tabarani.</h5>
<h5>Abu Hurayra said that the Prophet said, Peace be upon him: "The earth and everything in it is cursed,
    except for dhikr and what attends dhikr, and a teacher (of dhikr) and a student (of dhikr)." Narrated by Tirmidhi</h5>
<h5>"Those who believe, and their hearts find satisfaction in the rememberance of Allah:
    By remembering Allah, truly satisfaction comes to the heart" (13:28).</h5>
<h5>Abu al-Darda' narrates: The Prophet once asked his companions: "Shall I tell you about the best of all deeds,
    the best act of piety in the eyes of your Lord, which will elevate your status in the Hereafter,
    and carries more virtue than the spending of gold and silver in the service of Allah or taking part in jihad
    and slaying or being slain in the path of Allah? The dhikr of Allah."
    Related in the Malik's Muwatta', the Musnad of Ahmad, the Sunan of Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and the Mustadrak of Hakim.</h5>
<h5>`Abd Allah ibn `Umar said that the Prophet used to say: "Everything has a polish, and the polish of hearts is dhikr
    of Allah. Nothing is more calculated to rescue from Allah's punishment than dhikr of Allah." He was asked whether
    this did not apply also to jihad in Allah's path, and he replied: "Not even if one should ply his sword until it breaks."
    Bayhaqi narrated it in Kitab al-da`awat al-kabir as well as in his Shu`ab al-iman (1:396 #522), also al-Mundhiri
    in al-Targhib (2:396) and Tibrizi mentions it in Mishkat al-masabih, at the end of the book of Supplications.</h5>
<h5>"Remember Me, and I shall remember you" (2:152)</h5>
<h5>The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The single-hearted (al-mufarridun) have surpassed all." They asked,
    "Who are these single-hearted people, O Prophet of Allah?" He replied, "Those men and women who remember Allah unceasingly." (Muslim)</h5>
<h5>the Prophet said: udhkur Allaha hatta yaqulu majnun "Remember / mention Allah as much as you want, until people
    say that you are crazy and foolish" (Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad, Ibn Hibban in his Sahih, and al-Hakim who declared it sahih);</h5>
<h5>"O you who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do so often; and glorify Him morning and evening." (33:41-42)</h5>
<h5>Mu'adh reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'No other act of man is a more effective means for
    his deliverance from the chastisement of Allah than the remembrance of Allah." (Narrated by Ahmad.)</h5>
<h5>"Those men and women who engage much in Allah's praise. For them has Allah prepared forgiveness and a great reward." (3:191, 33:35)</h5>
<h5>And mention the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion" (73:8)</h5>
<h5>The Prophet also said: "Remembrance of Allah is firm knowledge of one's belief, immunity from hypocrisy,
    a fortress against satan, and a guarded refuge from the fire." It was mentioned by al-Layth al-Samarqandi.</h5>
<h5>Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya9 said - may Allah be well pleased with him: "Verily the angels lower their gaze in the
    presence of the rememberer of Allah, just as the people lower their gaze before lightning."</h5>
